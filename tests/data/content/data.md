## Non-native components

[m](tri-se-3) is a variant of [mp](tri-se?nt).
Neither occur on [wf](tri-fire), because it is a noun.
They are related to [mp](apa-se,way-se?nt).
This is thus a cognate set shared by [lg](apa,way,tri).

* If [wf](tri-kure) has too long a translation, try [wf](tri-kure?translation=good).

* This dataset contains the [lg](ikp) text [txt](ikp-ekiri).
