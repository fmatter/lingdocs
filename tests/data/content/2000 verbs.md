# Integrating linguistic entities [label](sec:linguistics)

This section demonstrates the core functinality of pylingdocs: including linguistic data in your prose.
This is achieved by using the [cldfviz](https://github.com/cldf/cldfviz/) tool to access data in the [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/) format.
A number of models are built-in to pylingdocs:

1. morphemes: [mp](apa-se)
2. [mp](tri-se).

[mp](apa-se,tri-se)


[m](tri-se-2)

[ex](ekiri-1)

[ex](ekiri-2,ekiri-3)
