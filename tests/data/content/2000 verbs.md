# Integrating linguistic entities [label](sec:linguistics)

The core functionality of pylingdocs is including linguistic data in your prose.
This is achieved by using the [cldfviz](https://github.com/cldf/cldfviz/) tool to access datasets in the [CLDF](https://cldf.clld.org/) format.
A number of models are built-in to pylingdocs:

1. morphemes: [mp](apa-se)
2. morphs: [m](apa-se-1)
3. languages: [lg](apa)

You can also refer to multiple entities of the same kind:

1. [mp](apa-se,tri-se)
2. [m](tri-se-2,apa-se-1)
3. [lg](apa,tri)


[ex](ekiri-1)

[ex](ekiri-2,ekiri-3)
