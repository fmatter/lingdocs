Introduction [sec:intro]

This document does double service as a test for pylingdocs and a
showcase of its capabilities. It aims to demonstrate every feature and
model currently available in pylingdocs.

Common markdown

You can use all the familiar markdown components. Here is a link to the
pylingdocs github repo. Here is some bold and italic and bold italic
text.

A quote:

  Locating an individual language on a given point of the
  ergativity-nominativity axis and the diachronic interpretation of this
  axis seem to be conceptually different concerns, even if we were to
  assume that there are principies favouring one direction over the
  other. (Álvarez 1997: 71)

Pylingdocs markdown [pld-md]

Apart from database references, discussed in [ref/sec:sources], there
are a number of pylingdocs-specific commands, all patterning like links:

-   cross-references: [ref/common-markdown] or [ref/sec:intro], see
    corresponding label commands
-   example references:
    -   single [ex:ekiri-13]
    -   subexample [ex:ekiri-10]
    -   range: [ex:ekiri-13–ekiri-11]
    -   or bare: [ex:ekiri-11]
-   glosses: ACC
-   todos: [todo: we need to talk about this]
-   tables (with automatically generated table labels like
    [ref/tab:consonants]):

Other linguistic data [sec:data]

Native CLDF components

-   forms: Tiriyó pakoro se wae ‘I want a house’
-   languages: Hixkaryána
-   cognate sets:

louse-1

  Form    Language   -   -   -   -   -
  ------- ---------- --- --- --- --- ---
  jamï    Tiriyó     -   j   a   m   o
  azamo   Apalaí     a   z   a   m   o
  əjamo   Wayana     ə   j   a   m   o

Non-native components

Tiriyó -e ‘SUP’ is a variant of Tiriyó -(s)e. Neither occur on , because
it is a noun. They are related to -se and -(h)e. This is thus a cognate
set shared by Apalaí, Tiriyó, and Wayana.

-   This dataset contains the Ikpeng text “The old man”.
