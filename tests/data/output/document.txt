Introduction

This document does double service as a test for pylingdocs and a
showcase of its capabilities. It aims to demonstrate every feature and
model currently available in pylingdocs.

Common markdown

You can use all the familiar markdown components. Here is a link to the
pylingdocs github repo. Here is some bold and italic and bold italic
text.

A quote:

  Locating an individual language on a given point of the
  ergativity-nominativity axis and the diachronic interpretation of this
  axis seem to be conceptually different concerns, even if we were to
  assume that there are principies favouring one direction over the
  other. (Álvarez 1997: 71)

Pylingdocs markdown

Apart from database references, discussed in 7, there are a number of
pylingdocs-specific commands, all patterning like links:

-   cross-references: 2 or 1, see corresponding label commands
-   example references:
    -   single (1)
    -   subexample (2b)
    -   range: (1)
    -   or bare: (3)
-   glosses: ACC
-   todos: [todo: we need to talk about this]
-   tables and figures (with automatically generated table labels like
    Table 3.1 and Figure 3.1):

Table 3.1: Consonant phonemes of Yawarana:

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
              bilabial     alveolar     palatal     velar     glottal

Other linguistic data

Native CLDF components

-   forms: Tiriyó pakoro se wae ‘I want a house’ (Meira 1999: 417)
-   languages: Hixkaryána
-   cognate sets:

None

Non-native components

Tiriyó -e ‘SUP’ (Meira 1999: 327) is a variant of Tiriyó -(s)e (Meira
1999: 327). Neither occur on Tiriyó ‘fire’ (Meira 1999: 314), because it
is a noun. They are related to -se and -(h)e. This is thus a cognate set
shared by Apalaí, Tiriyó, and Wayana.

-   If Tiriyó ‘good / pretty / well’ (Meira 1999: 345) has too long a
    translation, try Tiriyó ‘good’ (Meira 1999: 345).

-   This dataset contains the Ikpeng text The old man.

Sometimes you want a non-interlinear example, maybe with a form, or a
simple list, or a table.
